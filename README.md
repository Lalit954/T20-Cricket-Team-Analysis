# T20-Cricket-Team-Analysis
Created a Power BI report to identify top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by scraping data from espncricinfo.
Cleaning and transforming the data with pandas, and evaluating various player performance metrics.
We were use the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories {openers, middle order/anchors, 
finishers, Fast bowlers} and ultimately choose the top 11 players to play in the match.
